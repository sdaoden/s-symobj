=head1 DESCRIPTION

SymObj.pm provides an easy way to create and construct symbol-tables
and objects.  With a simple hash one defines the fields an object
should have, and the desired accessors and a constructor subroutine
will be automatically generated.  Subroutines which deal with arrays
and hashes implement a I<feed in and forget> approach, in that hash
and array arguments are unfolded; the constructor will behave this way
for all managed array and hash fields.

If debug was enabled upon symbol-table creation time a verbose and
error checking constructor is used.  Otherwise a straight constructor
without any checking will be created; and if the managed object is the
head of a "clean" object tree, i.e., one that is entirely managed by
S-SymObj, then a super-fast super-lean constructor implementation is
used that'll rock your house.

SymObj.pm works for Multiple-Inheritance as good as perl(1) allows.
(That is to say that only one straight object tree can be used, further
trees of C<@ISA> need to be joined into the C<$self> hash and thus
loose I<their> C<$self> along the way, of course.)  It should integrate
neatlessly into SMP in respect to objects; package "static-data" however
is not protected.  Note that S-SymObj does I<not> add tweaks to the
perl(1) object mechanism in respect to superclasses that occur multiple
times in the C<@ISA> of some class; this is because the resulting
behaviour would differ for clean S-SymObj managed and mixed trees, as
well as for debug and non-debug mode (though that could be managed,
actually).

B<Note> that it is not possible to use an object tree with mixed
S-SymObj managed and non-managed classes in B<mixed order>, as in
I<MANAGED subclassof NON-MANAGED subclassof MANAGED>, because tree
traversal actually stops once a I<NON-MANAGED> class is seen.  This
is logical, because non-managed classes do not contain the necessary
information for S-SymObj to function.

The SymObj module is available on CPAN.  The S-SymObj project is located
at L<https://www.sdaoden.eu/code.html>.  It is developed using a git(1)
repository, which is located at C<https://git.sdaoden.eu/scm/s-symobj.git>
(browse it at L<https://git.sdaoden.eu/browse/s-symobj.git>).

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<$VERSION> (string, i.e., '0.8.2')

A version string.

=item C<$COPYRIGHT> (string)

A multiline string which contains a summary of the copyright license.
S-SymObj is provided under the terms of the ISC license.

=item C<$MsgFH> (default: C<*STDERR>)

This is the file handle where all debug and verbose messages will be
written to.

=item C<$Debug> (0=off, 1=on, 2=verbose; default: 1)

If set to a value different than 0 then a lot of debug checks are
performed, and a rather slow object-constructor path is chosen (see
below).  If set to a value greater than 1 then message verbosity is
increased.  All messages go to L<"MsgFH">.

B<Note:> changing this value later on will neither affect the
object-constructor paths nor the per-object settings of classes and
class-objects that already have been instantiated.

=item C<NONE>

Flag for L<"sym_create">, value 0.

=item C<DEBUG>

Bit-flag for L<"sym_create">, meaning to enable debug on a per-object
level.  Cannot be used to overwrite an enabled L<"Debug">, but will
be recognized otherwise.

=item C<VERBOSE>

Bit-flag for L<"sym_create">, meaning to enable verbosity on a per-object
level.  Cannot be used to overwrite an enabled L<"Debug">, but will
be recognized otherwise.

=item C<DEEP_CLONE>

Bit-flag for L<"sym_create">.  If this is set then values from the
per-class reference hash are deep cloned upon object construction time.
Normally these fields are reference-copied except for the first,
immediate level, which is shallow cloned; i.e., if the value is an
array or hash, that very array or hash is cloned, but the values within
it are only reference copied.  But if this flag is set then array and
hash members are I<recursively> cloned in addition.  E.g.:

   SymObj::sym_create(SymObj::NONE, {array => [1, [2, 3]]});
   ->
   $o = XXX->new;
   die unless $o->array->[1]->[0] == 2;
   XXX::array()->[0] = -1;
   die unless $o->array->[0] == 1;
   XXX::array()->[1]->[0] = -2;
   die unless $o->array->[1]->[0] == -2;

   SymObj::sym_create(SymObj::DEEP_CLONE, {array => [1, [2, 3]]});
   ->
   $o = XXX->new;
   die unless $o->array->[1]->[0] == 2;
   XXX::array()->[0] = -1;
   die unless $o->array->[0] == 1;
   XXX::array()->[1]->[0] = -2;
   die unless $o->array->[1]->[0] == 2

This flag will be overwritten by subclasses, i.e., the C<DEEP_CLONE>
state of the I<actually instantiated> subclass is what is used to
decide whether deep cloning shall be performed or not.

=item C<pack_exists(C<$1>=string=package/class)>

Check whether the class (package) $1 exists.

=item C<sym_dump($1=string OR object=symbol table target)>

Dump the symbol table entries of the package or object C<$1>.

=item C<obj_dump($1=$self)>

This is in fact a wrapper around C<Dumper::dump>.

=item C<sym_create($1=int=flags, $2=hash-ref=fields[, $3=code-ref/string])>

Create accessor methods/functions in the class package from within
which this function is called (best from within a C<BEGIN{}> block)
for all keys of C<$2>, after inspecting and adjusting them for access
modifiers, and do the "magic" S-SymObj symbol housekeeping, too.  C<$2>
may be the empty anonymous hash if the class does not introduce fields
on its own.  Note that a reference to C<$2> is internally stored as
L<"$_SymObj_FIELDS"> and used for the time being!  It should thus be
assumed that ownership of C<$2> is overtaken by S-SymObj.

C<$1> can be used to set per-class (package that is) flags, like
L<"DEBUG"> or L<"DEEP_CLONE">.  Flags set like that will be inherited
by all subclasses (unless otherwise noted).  It is not possible to
lower the global L<"Debug"> state on this basis, though.

C<$3> is the optional per-object user constructor, which can be used
to perform additional setup of C<$self> as necessary.  These user
constructors take two arguments, C<$self>, the newly created object,
and C<$pkg>, the class name of the actual (sub)class that is
instantiated.  (Well, maybe partially created up to some point in
C<@ISA>.)  The user constructor doesn't have a return value.

If C<$3> is used, it must either be a code-reference or a string.  In
the latter case S-SymObj will try to locate a method of the given name
once the first object of the managed type is created, and set this to
be the user constructor.  If C<$3> is not used, S-SymObj will look for
a method named C<__ctor> once the first object of the managed type is
created.  B<Note> that the string and auto-search cases are not
thread-protected and may thus introduce races in multithreaded programs.
If in doubt, pass a code-reference.

SymObj generally "enforces" privacy (by definition) via an underscore
prefix: all keys of C<$2> are expected to start with an underscore,
but the public accessor methods will miss that (C<_data> becomes
C<data>).  This is actually a requirement that is checked if debug is
enabled, since SymObj won't function properly for this field otherwise.

The created accessor subs work as methods if the first argument that
is seen is a reference that seems to be a class instantiation (i.e.,
C<$self>, as in C<$self-E<gt>name()>) and as functions otherwise
(C<SomePack::name()>), in which case the provided package template
hash (C<$2>) is used!  (Note that no locking is performed in the latter
case, i.e., this should not be done in multithreaded programs.)  If
they act upon arrays or hashes they'll return references to the members
by default, but do return shallow clones in C<wantarray> context instead.

If a key in C<$2> is prefixed with an AT or a PERCENT, as in C<'@_name'>
or C<'%_name'>, respectively, then the field in question is assumed
to be an array or hash, respectively.  By default S-SymObj uses the
value to figure out which kind of accessor has to be used, but for
that the value must be set to a value different to C<undef>, which is
sometimes not desirable, e.g., when a field should be lazy allocated,
only if it is really used.  Note that the generic accessors will
automatically instantiate an empty array/hash as necessary in these
cases once the field is accessed first.

After the (optional) C<@> or C<%> type modifier, one may use (also
optionally) C<?> or C<!>, mutually exclusive, as an access modifier.
If a question mark is seen, as in C<'?_name'>, then this means that
no accessor subs will be created for C<name>.  Just likewise for
exclamation mark, as in C<'!_name'>, there will only be a readonly
accessor sub available.  Write access will be actively rejected in
this case.

Whatever type and/or access modifier(s) was/were present, they will
be stripped from the field name, just like a following underscore will,
i.e., a field C<'@!_name'> will actually end up as C<_name> in the
class-static hash, with the accessor subroutinge C<name>.

In addition to those accessor subs there will I<always> be private
accessor subs be created which use the public name prefixed with two
underscores, as in C<$self-E<gt>__name()>.  These subs do nothing
except returning a reference to the field in question.  They're ment
to be used instead of direct access to members in some contexts, i.e.,
for encapsulation purposes.  Note that they do I<not> automatically
instantiate lazy allocated fields.

Note that, if any of the superclasses of C<$1>, as detected through
its C<@ISA> array, provides fields which have identical names to what
is provided in C<$2>, one specifies an overwrite request, and it is
verified that the value type matches.  Unfortunately the subclass will
create accessor subs on its own, because users need to be able to
adjust the class-static data.  And, also unfortunately, different
access policies won't be detected.

=item C<clone_ref($1=ref, $2=boolean=deep-clone-reference)>

Calling this support sub clones the variable C<$1>, which is treated
as a plain scalar unless it is a HASH or ARRAY reference.  If C<$2>
is not false then C<clone_ref()> recurses for the variable, cloning
all levels until no more HASH or ARRAY references remain (uncloned).
The final perl variable is returned.  (This is the logic behind
C<DEEP_CLONE>.)

=back

=head1 INJECTED SYMBOLS

For completeness sake, here is a list of all the symbols that S-SymObj
creates internally for each managed package.

=over

=item C<$_SymObj_PACKAGE>

The C<__PACKAGE__>.

=item C<$_SymObj_ISA>

A copy of the class's C<@ISA>, including the class itself.  This indeed
is the entire unfolded class tree, unfolded in down-top, left-right
(a.k.a construction) order.

=item C<$_SymObj_ALL_CTOR_ARGS>

A hash that includes all arguments that the constructor is allowed to
take.  (Won't cover classes that are not managed by S-SymObj.)

=item C<$_SymObj_CTOR_OVERRIDES>

A list of all fields that this package overrides from superclasses.
(Won't cover classes that are not managed by S-SymObj.)

=item C<$_SymObj_FIELDS>

The reference to the field hash, as given to L<"sym_create"> (modified
to not include field-access modifier characters).

=item C<$_SymObj_FLAGS>

Some flags. :)

=item C<$_SymObj_USR_CTOR>

An optional field that holds a reference to the users constructor (once
resolved).

=item C<new()>

The auto-generated public class constructor.

=back

=head1 NEWS

=over

=item v0.8.2, 2016-10-24

Fixed false spelling, updated URLs, new source-code style.
No functional change (since v0.8.0, 2012-12-17).

=item v0.8.1, 2016-01-05

Only housekeeping updates (URLs, copyright, etc).

=item v0.8.0, 2012-12-17

Support for L<"DEEP_CLONE"> was added.
The code has been reordered.
Much lesser generated code is injected into classes.

=back

=head1 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Optional (flag driven) thread safety for static data access.
Thread safety for resolving the user-constructor (maybe).

Maybe add support for class members, but the problem here is of course
the default-argument nature of S-SymObj; we could however require
initialization of the member with a C<package, callback> tuple to (1)
test references of given objects (via perl(1) UNIVERSAL, then) and
initialize default objects if none has been given by user.

Finally: realize that perl(1) ships with struct and class and similar
things which head in the very same direction as S-SymObj.  I want to
point out that i wrote this package the hard way.  It is I.
